# Project Map for Refactoring: the-notebook-mcp

This document provides a map of the `the-notebook-mcp` project to aid in a large refactoring effort, primarily focusing on reorganization and library updates.

## 1. Project Overview

(Assuming from `README.md` and file structure)
The project `the-notebook-mcp` appears to be a backend system or library for managing and manipulating Jupyter Notebooks. It provides tools (likely an API or server endpoints) for operations like creating, deleting, editing cells, exporting notebooks, and managing metadata. The name "MCP" (Master Control Program) suggests a central role in notebook operations.

## 3. Key Directories and Files Analysis

### 3.1. `the_notebook_mcp/` (Main Source Code)

This is the core of the application and will be a primary focus for refactoring.

*   `__init__.py`: Package initializer. May define public API or import key modules.
*   `notebook_ops.py`: (114 lines) Likely contains fundamental, low-level notebook operations (reading, writing, path validation). These functions are used by `tools.py`.
*   `tools.py`: (1281 lines) Defines a `NotebookTools` class that encapsulates higher-level notebook manipulation tools, likely registered with an MCP (Master Control Program) instance. This is a large file and a candidate for potential reorganization (e.g., splitting into smaller, more focused modules). It handles various aspects like cell editing, metadata, import diagnostics, validation, export, etc.
*   `server.py`: (292 lines) Suggests the project runs as a server, exposing the notebook tools, possibly via an HTTP API (e.g., using FastAPI, Flask). It likely initializes the `NotebookTools` and handles incoming requests.
*   `sse_transport.py`: (158 lines) Implies Server-Sent Events are used, possibly for real-time updates or streaming responses from the server (e.g., cell execution outputs).

**Refactoring Considerations for `the_notebook_mcp/`:**
*   **`tools.py` Reorganization:** Given its size, consider breaking `NotebookTools` or its methods into smaller, more cohesive modules based on functionality (e.g., `cell_tools.py`, `metadata_tools.py`, `io_tools.py`).
*   **Dependency Updates:** Check for outdated libraries used within these modules.
*   **API Design:** If refactoring involves API changes, `server.py` and `tools.py` will need significant updates.
*   **Async Operations:** Note the use of `async` in `tools.py`. Ensure concurrency patterns are efficient and correct.

### 3.2. `tests/`

Contains automated tests.

*   `fixtures/`: Holds test data, which might include sample `.ipynb` files or configurations.
*   Test files (e.g., `test_tools.py`, `test_server.py` - *names inferred*): These will need to be updated to reflect any changes in `the_notebook_mcp/`.

**Refactoring Considerations for `tests/`:**
*   Ensure test coverage is maintained or improved.
*   Update tests to match new APIs or reorganized modules.
*   Add new tests for any new functionality or refactored logic.

### 3.3. `.github/workflows/`

Contains CI/CD pipelines.

*   Workflow files (e.g., `ci.yml`, `publish.yml` - *names inferred*): These scripts define automated processes like running tests, linting, building, and deploying the package.

**Refactoring Considerations for `.github/workflows/`:**
*   Update Python versions, dependency installation steps, and test execution commands if they change.
*   Ensure the CI pipeline correctly reflects the new project structure or build process.

### 3.4. `examples/`

Provides usage examples.

**Refactoring Considerations for `examples/`:**
*   Update example code to reflect any API changes or new usage patterns.
*   Ensure examples are still functional after refactoring.

### 3.5. Configuration and Metadata Files

*   `pyproject.toml`: Central project configuration.
    *   **Dependencies:** This is where library versions are specified. A key part of the refactor will be updating these (e.g., `nbformat`, `nbconvert`, any web framework used).
    *   **Build System:** Defines how the project is built.
    *   **Project Metadata:** Name, version, author, etc.
*   `.python-version`: Ensure this aligns with the Python version used for development and deployment after library updates.
*   `MANIFEST.in`: Check if it needs updates if file organization changes significantly.
*   `README.md`: Update setup instructions, API overviews, or architectural descriptions if they change.
*   `CHANGELOG.md`: Maintain a meticulous record of changes during refactoring.

## 4. General Refactoring Strategy Considerations

*   **Library Updates:**
    *   Identify key libraries (e.g., `nbformat`, `nbconvert`, web framework, testing framework).
    *   Research breaking changes in new versions.
    *   Update one library at a time, if possible, and run tests.
*   **Reorganization:**
    *   Focus on improving modularity and readability in `the_notebook_mcp/`.
    *   Ensure import paths are updated correctly after moving files/modules.
*   **Testing:**
    *   Rely heavily on the test suite. Improve it if necessary before starting major changes.
    *   Run tests frequently.
*   **Version Control:**
    *   Use branches for different refactoring tasks.
    *   Commit frequently with clear messages.
*   **Documentation:**
    *   Update docstrings, `README.md`, and other documentation as changes are made.

## 5. Suggested Next Steps (Pre-Refactor)

1.  **Deep Dive into `pyproject.toml`:** Analyze current dependencies and their versions. Identify candidates for updates.
2.  **Review `README.md`:** Get a clearer understanding of the project's stated purpose and setup.
3.  **Explore `tests/`:** Understand the current test coverage and structure.
4.  **Examine `notebook_ops.py` and `server.py`:** Understand how `tools.py` integrates with the rest of the system.
5.  **Plan `tools.py` Split:** Before coding, sketch out a potential new structure for the functionality currently in `tools.py`.

This map should serve as a good starting point for planning and executing the refactoring.
